            Considering purchasing a used Volkswagen or Audi? We recommend a
            full inspection be performed by a party independent of the seller
            before any used vehicle purchase.
          </p>
          <p>
            We offer pre-purchase inspections that provide you with a full and
            unbiased overview of the vehicle's condition + any needed repairs.
            Dubsquared offers this service for a flat fee of
            <span class="font-bold text-green-400">$130</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll receive a full report with pictures, notes on what was found,
            and a full vehicle fault scan. Clients typically use this report as
            leverage in purchase negotiations or to plan for future repairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The vehicle will need to be brought to our shop but most reputable
            used car dealers and individual sellers will allow third party
            inspections before purchase.
