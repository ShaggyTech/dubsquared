          Considering purchasing a used Volkswagen or Audi? We recommend a full
          inspection be performed by a party independent of the seller before
          any used vehicle purchase. We offer pre-purchase inspections that
          provide you with a full and unbiased overview of the vehicle's
          condition + any needed repairs. Dubsquared offers this service for a
          flat fee of
          <span class="font-teko font-bold text-green-400">$130</span>.
        </div>
        <div>
          You'll receive a full report with pictures, notes on what was found,
          and a full vehicle fault scan. Clients typically use this report as
          leverage in purchase negotiations or to plan for future repairs.
          You'll need to bring the vehicle to our shop but most reputable used
          car dealers and individual sellers will allow third party inspections
          before purchase.
