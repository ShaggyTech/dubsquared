          glance under the hood to check for any additional preventative
          maintenance services you might need. Our goal is to keep your car at
          optimal performance for years to come.

      <template #heading-text>Pre-purchase Inspections</template>
      <template #paragraph>
        <p>
          Considering purchasing a used Volkswagen or Audi? We recommend a full
          inspection be performed by a party independent of the seller before
          any used vehicle purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer pre-purchase inspections that provide you with a full and
          unbiased overview of the vehicle's condition + any needed repairs.
          Dubsquared offers this service for a flat fee of
          <span class="font-bold text-green-400">$130</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll receive a full report with pictures, notes on what was found,
          and a full vehicle fault scan. Clients typically use this report as
          leverage in purchase negotiations or to plan for future repairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vehicle will need to be brought to our shop but most reputable
          used car dealers and individual sellers will allow third party
          inspections before purchase.
